Test 1: Probability is number of favourable outcomes divided total outcomes.
Answer: None
Working: According to the steps provided by the student, I first identified the probability of Ashley drawing a blue ball from the initial set of balls. The total number of balls is 10 (3 green, 2 blue, and 5 red). Ashley's favorable outcome is to draw a blue ball, and there are 2 of those. So, the probability of Ashley drawing a blue ball is the number of blue balls (2) divided by the total number of balls (10). But without further steps, I don't know how to proceed further.
