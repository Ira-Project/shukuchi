### Probability

Question: Ashley's class is doing experiments with probability. They have a box with 3 green balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 red balls. Ashley takes a ball from the box, keeps the ball, and passes the box to Manuel. What is the probability that Ashley gets a blue ball and Manuel gets a green ball?

## How it Works?

We are using two assistants in this experiment. One to confirm the validity of the explanation and the second to perform calculations. The first assistant returns a working based on what it is able to understand from the calculation. The second assistant uses the working and calculates the result using the working.
