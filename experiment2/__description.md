### Probability

Question: Ashley's class is doing experiments with probability. They have a box with 3 green balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 red balls. Ashley takes a ball from the box, keeps the ball, and passes the box to Manuel. What is the probability that Ashley gets a blue ball and Manuel gets a green ball?

We created a prob_concepts.json file that lists all the basic concepts for grade 10 probability. We are trying use that file to inform the OPEN AI assistant on how to solve the problem.
