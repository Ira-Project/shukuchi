    "general_concepts": [
        "Is the force in the spring proportional to the change in length of the spring?",
        "Does the force in the spring oppose any changes in it's length?",
        "Is the formula for spring force equal to the spring constant times the displacement?",
        "Is the formula for work equal to force times displacement?",
        "To calculate work done, only the force applied in the direction of displacement is considered?",
        "Is the formula for elastic potential energy equal to 1/2 * spring constant * (spring displacement**2)?"
