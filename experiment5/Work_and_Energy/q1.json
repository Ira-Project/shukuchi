    "Question": "A boy pulls a box across a rough, horizontal surface using a rope. The box is moving at a steady speed. The friction on the box is 300 N and the rope is at angle of 30Â° to the horizontal. Find the work done by the boy to move the box a distance of 100m across the horizontal surface.",
