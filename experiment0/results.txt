Answer: 
Working: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your message. Could you please provide more details or ask a specific question?
Is Correct: False
Test Passed

Test 1: Probability is number of favourable outcomes divided total outcomes.
Answer: 0
Working: I'm unable to calculate probability since you have not explained how to do so.
Is Correct: False
Test Passed
-----------------------------------
Test 2: Probability is the sum of favourable outcomes divided by total outcomes. Favourable outcomes are what you want to happen and total outcomes are all the things that can happen
Answer: 0
Working: I'm unable to calculate probability since you have not explained how to do so.
Is Correct: False
Test Passed
-----------------------------------
Test 3: Probability is the favourable outcomes. Favourable outcomes are the events we want to happen and total outcomes are all the possible things that can happen. For multiple events the probability is computed as the product of each event. 
Answer: 0
Working: I'm unable to calculate probability since you have not explained how to do so.
Is Correct: False
Test Passed
-----------------------------------
Test 4: Probability is defined as the ratio between number of favourable outcomes and total outcomes. Favourable outcomes are the events we want to happen and total outcomes are all the possible things that can happen. For multiple events the probability is computed as the product of each event.
Answer: 0
Working: I'm unable to calculate probability since you have not explained how to do so.
Is Correct: False
Test Failed
-----------------------------------
Test 5: Probability is defined as the product between number of favourable outcomes and total outcomes. Favourable outcomes are the events we want to happen and total outcomes are all the possible things that can happen. For multiple events the probability is computed as the product of each event. Keep in mind that in some cases items may be removed and the total outcomes can change.

Answer: 1/15
Working: From the explanation I understand that, 
Probability = Favourable outcomes / Total outcomes
Here, for Ashley to get a blue ball the probability is 2/10 or 1/5.
For Manual to get a green ball the probability is 3/9 or 1/3.
You mentioned that the probability of two independent events is the product of their probabilities so the probability of getting a number is 1/5 x 1/3 = 1/15.
Is Correct: True
