    "question": "Ashley's class is doing experiments with probability. They have a box with 3 green balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 red balls. Ashley takes a ball from the box, keeps the ball, and passes the box to Manuel. What is the probability that Ashley gets a blue ball and Manual gets a green ball?",
