### Probability

Question: Ashley's class is doing experiments with probability. They have a box with 3 green balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 red balls. Ashley takes a ball from the box, keeps the ball, and passes the box to Manuel. What is the probability that Ashley gets a blue ball and Manuel gets a green ball?

We have got some success with basic prompt engineering but it was not perfect. What we're going to do is break down each question and see how it goes. Once again, this is likely going to increase costs and is not particularly scaleable but the goal is to get a good user experience first.

##### Elements required of a good explanation

- Definition of probability ratio between favourable and total outcomes
- What are favourable and total outcomes and how must it be computed
- Total number of outcomes of the independent events is the product of the outcomes of the events
- For some experiments it's possible that when an item is removed the calculation changes
